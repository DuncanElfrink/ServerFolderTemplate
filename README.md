<p>Server Folder Template
            <br><br>
            Yeah, not actually an update, but...
            Today I want to share you guys my Server Folder Template.
            <br><br>
            It's just a folder how I setup my files, for example "data" folder has all my Framework scripts and giggles, but the "server" folder has the FiveM Artifacts contents.
            <br><br>
            Now you guys think, that's nothing...
            No I know I am just showing how I have ordered things up, with how I think it makes sense a bit.
            <br><br>
            <b><u>Server Starter & Server Updater</u></b>
            The thing is... It also has an <b>Server Starter.bat</b> script and an <b>Server Updater.bat</b> script.
            <br><br>
            The <b>Server Starter.bat</b> script does, like you know, start the server up.
            But the <b>Server Updater.bat</b>, that's the good part, will update your FiveM Artifacts, from the FiveM website straight inside the "server" folder I called earlier.
            It removes the old version, and installs the new one, if there is any.
            <br><br>
            Both scripts are both functional for any Task Scheduling.
            <br><br>
            Well... I also included some README's for you know...

            Goodluck and have fun!</p>
