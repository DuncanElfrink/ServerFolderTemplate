Welcome !


To use this at it's finest you need to do 3 things!

1) Put your files inside the "data" folder. What files? Check the "data" folder for another README.txt if you don't know what files.
2) Press Server Updater.bat, this script will download the latest Artifacts straight from the FiveM Artifacts website.
3) Press Server Starter.bat, this script will start your server! 
 

You can btw, always use the Server Updater.bat script to update your artifacts whenever you want, as it also checks if there is even a new one available.

You can run both files in a Task Scheduler / Cron, for example for the Server Starter at VPS/Dedi Startup, and the Server Updater every week or so?


IMPORTANT! When you want to use Server Updater.bat be sure you have closed your server totally before doing, 
else there can be some issues with the "server" folder, no worries nothing happends with your "data" folder.


Have fun! :)
